				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="itemIntroText">
<p>As an environmental consultant, I work in a field that depends on data. This may seem obvious, but when you think about it, you start to realize that the better the data quality, the better the opportunity to observe and interpret a given subject. Thus, we are always on the look out for new ways to acquire high quality data. Our firm has recently incorporated <a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/mapping-a-modelling/uav-aerial-photo-survey">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)</a> technology into our operations to collect aerial imagery, near-infrared imagery, and Digital Terrain Surface (DTS) data.</p>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText">
<p>Aerial photography is a common data source for many environmental practitioners. As a result of the budget, weather, and timing constraints of a project, it is often not feasible to collect aerial imagery via traditional aircraft. Technologies for acquiring aerial imagery are rapidly developing, allowing for the commercial application of UAVs. UAV technology (drones) was developed initially for military applications, but it has advanced to the point where it can be applied to environmental data collection as well. UAVs are now being deployed to collect near-real time imagery for use as aerial photos, near infra-red imagery and to generate 3D digital surface models. UAV technology has also enabled access to site specific, near real-time aerial imagery; data treatment options that complement and integrate into GIS and drafting systems; and cost effective analysis methods that employ high resolution imagery. Since the flight path is GPS controlled, the operation can be precise and repeatable for seasonal or annual monitoring, updates or reporting.</p>
<p>Applications for this technology are broad. Fields where this technology is immediately applicable include mining and gravel extraction, agricultural monitoring, civil engineering and construction, planning and development, <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/forestry-and-wildfire-management">forestry</a></b>, and transportation. The product is a site-specific, high resolution image mosaic that is orthorectified and geo-referenced. The image mosaic can be acquired by full colour or near-infrared cameras depending on application and data requirements. Some data treatment examples include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The use of near-infrared imagery for producing Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps, which represent direct measures of plant vigour. This technology is increasingly applied in viticulture and agriculture.</li>
<li>The creation of 3-D surface models that can be generated for sites requiring volumetrics. This technique is increasingly applied in cut and fill applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>The availability of up-to-date and repeatable UAV acquired aerial imagery will enable greater and more thorough desktop review and analysis of project, research and monitoring locations. The cost-effectiveness and flexibility of the technology will permit the collection of aerial imagery data in projects that may not have previously had access to this type of information. Applications and uses of these technologies will only grow as UAVs evolve. Within environmental consulting, we can see incorporation of this technology into environmental assessments, <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/environmental-monitoring-a-restoration">environmental monitoring</a></b>, habitat restoration, <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/forestry-and-wildfire-management">forestry</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/forestry-and-wildfire-management">wildfire</a></b>, along with GIS modelling and <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/mapping-a-modelling">mapping</a></b>.</p>
<p>The environmental sector will benefit from the availability of up-to-date, site-specific, cost-effective and repeatable aerial image data collection. The images are available almost immediately after flight. The flexibility and manoeuvrability of the technology allow data to be collected from locations that are difficult to access, potentially dangerous and previously expensive to get to. Rather than relying on outdated imagery, a consultant, manager or researcher can now work with recent GIS capable data.</p>
<p>Resources</p>
<p>The commercial application of UAVs is regulated and monitored in Canada by Transport Canada. This ensures that UAVs are operated safely and that properly trained, experienced operators are at the controls.</p>

<p>What is RAR? &amp; Why does RAR matter?</p>
<p><em>RAR &#8211; Riparian Areas Regulation</em></p>
<p>Riparian areas are the vegetated borders of stream and lakes. Riparian vegetation provides high value habitat for birds and animals, and is very important for the health of freshwater fisheries. In much of BC we protect riparian habitat with the Riparian Areas Regulation (RAR).</p>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText">
<p>Where does RAR apply?</p>
<p>If a proposed development is within 30 meters of stream a RAR assessment may be necessary to ensure that this critical habitat is not lost or damaged. Under RAR a stream can refer to a watercourse (even if dry), pond, lake, river, creek, brook, ditch, spring, or wetland. RAR is not applicable in all areas of BC. Following is a list of areas where RAR is used: Capital Region, Central Okanagan, Columbia-Shuswap, Comox-Strathcona, Cowichan Valley, Fraser Valley, Greater Vancouver (except the city of Vancouver), Nanaimo, North Okanagan, Okanagan-Similkameen, Powell River, Squamish-Lillooet, Sunshine Coast, Thompson-Nicola, Trust area under the Islands Trust Act</p>
<p>When does RAR apply?</p>
<p>As mentioned, RAR applies to development projects on properties within 30 m of a stream. Development can refer to; changes to the vegetation, soil work, construction, flood protection, road or trail construction, installation of a dock or bridge, maintenance of sewer and water <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/services">services</a></b>, installation of drainage systems or utility corridors, and subdivision.</p>
<p>Who should I call?</p>
<p>RAR assessments are performed by Qualified Environmental Professionals (QEPs). <strong>Valhalla Environmental</strong>&#8216;s QEPs will assist you in determining the location and value of the habitat and the  setback (SPEA) for the riparian area. Our QEPs will provide measures to protect the SPEA, prevent damages to the habitat by the proposed development and help you through the permitting process.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation/stage-1-psi--phase-i-esa">Stage 1 Preliminary Site Investigation</a> (<a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation/stage-1-psi--phase-i-esa">Phase I Environmental Site Assessment</a>) is an important tool for property owners, investors, realtors, lenders, financial institutions and more. The <a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation/stage-1-psi--phase-i-esa">Stage 1 PSI</a> allows you to go into a property deal with your eyes open to the potential environmental liabilities present. Following is a brief outline and the 5 Ws on <a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation/stage-1-psi--phase-i-esa">Stage 1</a>s.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;A lending organization or individual who takes possession of [a Contaminated Site] &#8230; may find that the property is worth very little. They may even find that the costs of a cleanup exceed the property&#8217;s value.&#8221; ~CMHC 2006</em></p>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText">
<p>Who? &#8211; A <a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation/stage-1-psi--phase-i-esa">Stage 1 Preliminary Site Investigation (PSI)</a>, otherwise known as a <a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation/stage-1-psi--phase-i-esa">Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)</a> is carried out by an Environmental Consultant for a client who is interested in determining the environmental risks of a property or site.</p>
<p>What? &#8211; The Stage 1 PSI is a method used to assist in determining potential environmental liabilities due to contamination on a site or property. This process involves a detailed review of land uses and history including a site visit, record searches, personal interviews and the evaluation of related information and reporting. This information is compiled and used to determine the potential of impact on a site due to contamination.</p>
<p>Where? &#8211; Most often PSI&#8217;s are used to assess commercial or industrial land prior to financing, acquisition tenancy or sale; but may be used in many circumstances to gather valuable environmental information on a property or site.</p>
<p>When? &#8211; Stage 1 Preliminary Site Investigations (PSI) or Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) may be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide a liability assessment prior to an acquisition or divestiture, or prior to tenancy of a property or site</li>
<li>provide due diligence measures in support of a real estate or financing agreement or to maintain compliance with a corporate stewardship policy</li>
<li>meet a regulatory request</li>
</ul>
<p>Why investigate? &#8211; 3 Reasons: Financial, Legal and Environmental</p>
<p>Financial concerns with <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation">contaminated sites</a></b> can quickly become significant.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;A buyer who borrows money to purchase a property that turns out to be contaminated may subsequently be prosecuted for environmental offences and face fines and legal and cleanup costs&#8230; If lenders then have to take possession of the contaminated property, they may be prosecuted or become liable for the debtor&#8217;s environmental problems, including clean up costs.&#8221; ~CMHC 2006</em></p>
<p>The Legal aspects of <b><a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation">contaminated sites</a></b> are complicated and potentially very expensive.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;A demonstration of due diligence has been used successfully as a defence strategy in legal cases dealing with environmental problems. If a lender or owner becomes involved in legal proceedings concerning contaminants at a particular site, a credible Phase I ESA, with appropriate follow-up, may help support a claim of due diligence.&#8221; ~CMHC 2006</em></p>
<p>Identification of Environmental features and receptors will assist in managing future site uses and potential contamination damages.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;A Phase I assessment may help reduce the environmental damage inflicted by contamination. By identifying potential problems, an ESA can alert those responsible to the need for cleanup or management of the contamination.&#8221; ~CMHC 2006</em></p>
<p>How? &#8211; To initiate or inquire about a PSI/ESA for a site or property contact a suitable qualified environmental professional to discuss details. Be sure to inquire about the standards and methodology that will be used.</p>
<p><strong>Valhalla Environmental</strong> meets the following <a href="http://www.valhallaconsulting.ca/contaminated-sites-a-remediation/stage-1-psi--phase-i-esa">Stage 1/Phase 1</a> Criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSA Standard &#8220;Z768-01 Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment&#8221; &#8211; Phase 1 ESA</li>
<li>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation CMHC guidelines</li>
<li>The requirements of the BC Ministry of Environment (MoE)</li>
</ul>
